## Description

This is a calculator application that carries out the functionality of a standard calculator, hence not as advanced as a scientific / graphical calculator. It currently contains keyboard and mouse functionality that allows users to type their calculations. As of now the operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as well as converting numbers to percentages.

## Future Plans

Increase functionality of the calculator to contain the that of a scientific calculator, e.g implementing trigonometric functions such as sin(), cos(), tan() etc.

## Known Bugs

The only known bug at this moment in time is the functionality of the forward slash key for division on Firefox ( the key brings up the quick find menu ).
